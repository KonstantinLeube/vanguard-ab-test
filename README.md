# Project Documentation:
First week:

Day 1&2: 
Manuel and i got familiar with the project overview and what was expected from us and then had a closer look at the data. After loading the Datasets into a jupyter notebook and familiarizing ourselves with the columns of each dataset, its contents and the meaning in the business context we started cleaning the data, replaced and dropped NaN-values, replaced possible typos in some coumns with fitting values and cocatenated the two datasets which were split into part 1 and part 2. Afterward we focused on the questions asked in the student portal and answered those by creating graphical representations. 

Day 3,4&5:
We finished up one single tasks from the first two days and started working on the KPI's. For our work on the KPI's we first filtered the relevant datasets for the information we wanted to display. After having completed this step we used graphical python libraries to represent our findings, always grouping the population into "test" and "control" group in order to be able to draw direct comparisons. The following steps performed were focused on the Hypothesis testing. When working on our hypothesis tests we made sure to formulate clear null- and alternative hypothesises that were fitting into the business context.

Second week:

Day 1&2:
Starting of into our second week we followed up on the last aspects of the hypotheses testings while also starting to work on the visualizations in Tableau. It took us some time working on the hypothesis tests and Tableau which is why it took us a bit longer than expected.

Day 3&4:
We finished up on all the assignment tasks and created a presentation on Google slides for Friday. After having troubles with Tableau we settled for a simpler approach after having talked with Ignacio and simply imported our visualizations into Tableau and alligned them on a dashboard. Lastly we also made sure that we had a complete and functioning GitHub repository for us to upload to the student portal.
